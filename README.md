# LangGraph Gemini GA4 Analytics

A conversational analytics assistant for GA4 e-commerce data that leverages LangGraph for workflow orchestration, Google Gemini for natural language processing, and BigQuery for data querying. This project simplifies the complex GA4 data structure, enabling users to extract actionable insights through plain English queries.

## Repository Contents

- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb):** Contains the implementation and interactive examples of the GA4 analytics assistant.
- **Schema File (.json):** A simplified GA4 schema representation focused on e-commerce analytics, used for generating accurate SQL queries.
- **Prompt File (.txt):** Contains the system prompt with detailed instructions for Google Gemini, including role guidance, SQL best practices, and example queries.

## Setup Instructions

### Configure Google Cloud Environment

- Set up your Google Cloud project and authenticate your environment.
- Update your project ID and region in the code as needed (e.g., `PROJECT_ID`, `REGION`).

### Run the Jupyter Notebook

- Open the provided `.ipynb` file to start interacting with the conversational GA4 analytics assistant.

## How It Works

The project workflow includes:

### Schema Loading
- A simplified GA4 schema is loaded to assist in constructing accurate SQL queries.

### Natural Language Query Translation
- User queries in plain English are converted into SQL queries that are compatible with BigQuery's GA4 data structure.

### Query Execution
- The generated SQL is executed against BigQuery, and the results are formatted and returned to the user.

### Final Answer Submission
- The assistant presents the results along with actionable insights in an easy-to-understand format.

## Example Query

For instance, when a user asks:

> "What's our total revenue from the last month?"

The agent will:

1. Generate an SQL query to calculate the total revenue.
2. Execute the query on BigQuery.
3. Return a summary such as:
   > "Based on the data, your total revenue for the last month was $X. This metric is crucial for evaluating overall business performance."

## Future Enhancements

- **Visualization Integration:** Automatic chart generation for numerical results.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Incorporate predictive analytics and anomaly detection for deeper insights.
- **Customized Reporting:** Enable scheduled reporting based on natural language specifications.
- **Cross-Source Analysis:** Extend data integration beyond GA4 to other relevant data sources.
